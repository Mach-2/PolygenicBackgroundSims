# Polygenic Background 
This repository contains the simulation code used in

> **Chapel, Dennis, & de Boer, 2025**. *Polygenic backgrounds influence phenotypic consequences of variants in cells, individuals, and populations.*

The repository contains two python scripts, which will reproduce the simulations and generate Figures 1 and 2 from the manuscript. 

`genetic-backgrounds.py` simulates how polygenic score (PGS), log odds ratios, and genetic background affect disease prevalence and risk. The output is a 4-panel figure illustrating these relationships (Figure 1). 

`PGS-distributions.py` simulates how the number of contributing genes increases the variance in disease liability (PGS). The output is a 2-panel figure illustrating these relationships (Figure 2).
